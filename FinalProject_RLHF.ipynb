    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to fine-tune a small GPT2 model (124M) using DPO and LoRA, with a dataset from Anthropic <a name=\"Anthropic/hh-rlhf\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, which contains approximately 16K high-quality conversational interactions. The data represents diverse dialogues measured by metrics such as coherence, relevance, and engagement. We will use this dataset to enhance our model's ability to generate human-like, contextually appropriate responses. Performance will be assessed using perplexity as the universal method across 3 different datasets. Success will be determined by the model's improved capability to produce coherent and engaging dialogues that mimic human conversation, and a lower perplexity score. After 1 epoch of training, the performance slightly improved, but there is a significant limitation due to the model size and the training time. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback has become a significant area of research in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The primary goal is to enhance the ability of AI models to understand and execute complex human instructions accurately and contextually. Early work in this domain involved supervised learning techniques, where models were trained on large datasets containing pairs of instructions and corresponding outputs<a name=\"vinyals2015\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. However, these methods often fell short in producing responses that aligned well with nuanced human preferences and expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, researchers have turned to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). This approach leverages human evaluators to provide feedback on model outputs, guiding the learning process to better align with human judgment. A notable advancement in this area was demonstrated by Christiano et al., who trained models using a combination of human preferences and reinforcement learning techniques to improve performance on complex tasks<a name=\"christiano2017\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, large-scale datasets have been curated to facilitate this line of research. The Anthropic/hh-rlhf dataset, for instance, contains approximately 160,000 high-quality conversational interactions and has been instrumental in training state-of-the-art models such as Zephyr-7B-Î²<a name=\"Anthropic/hh-rlhf\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This dataset includes diverse and context-rich dialogues, providing a robust foundation for fine-tuning models to generate human-like and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent studies have also emphasized the importance of combining automatic metrics with human evaluations to assess model performance comprehensively. Metrics such as perplexity offer quantitative insights, and it is also the universal method to evaluate the performance of language models, and can be applied across different datasets and tasks. <a name=\"gpt2note\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the training process more efficient, we used DPO and LoRA technologies to increase computing speed and make full use of limited GPU memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DPO\n",
    "The key insight of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is the pre-trained model itself already has a certain ability to distribute rewards, so there is no need for an explicit reward model<a name=\"DPO\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Therefore, with the preference dataset that compares two answers, the model can be trained to maximize the probability of the preferred answer. DPO is simpler to implement compared to traditional RLHF pipelines and PPO algorithm. RLHF usually requires training multiple language models (Actor, Critic, Reward model, Reference model) and sampling the LM policy during training, whereas DPO optimizes preference learning through a straightforward classification objective, avoiding such complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "DPO use a loss function that increase the probability of the preferred response while decreasing that of the non-preferred response: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{DPO}} = - \\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \\sim D} \\left[ \\log \\sigma \\left( \\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi(y_w|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y_w|x)} - \\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi(y_l|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y_l|x)} \\right) \\right]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\(\\sigma\\) is the logistic sigmoid function, \\(y_w\\) and \\(y_l\\) denote the preferred and less preferred responses respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LoRA\n",
    "Low-rank adaptation is a common fine-turn method to make a base model have a better performance in a downstream task. Inspired by the finding that a large model may not fully utilize their express ability, and those weights have low rank intrinsically, Edward Hu, et al. hypothesize that the amount of weight change also has this low rank property. Based on LORA, fine-turning only need a small amount of parameter to adjust a large model; a larger matrix is the product of two smaller matrices with a much lower rank <a name=\"LoRA\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less parameters to update significantly reduce the optimizer's memory footprint and computation cost, which is crucial for training large models."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are addressing is improving the ability of language models to generate responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also align closely with human preferences. Traditional language models, despite their sophistication, often produce outputs that lack coherence, relevance, or engagement when responding to complex instructions or participating in extended dialogues. Sometimes the outputs can be toxic. This gap between model-generated outputs and human expectations limits the practical usability of these models in real-world applications, such as customer service, virtual assistants, and conversational agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Standard Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential solution involves fine-tuning pre-trained language models using DPO. This method allows the model to learn from human preferences directly, optimizing for responses that humans find more acceptable. The process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Utilize the Anthropic dataset, which contains high-quality conversational interactions, to provide a rich training ground for fine-tuning. Gather human feedback on model-generated responses to create a reward signal for reinforcement learning. In fact, it can be an iterative process, that uses a small amount of data to fine-tune the model first, then use the model to generate more pairs of answers for humans to rank them. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Training: Pre-train the model using large-scale datasets to learn general language patterns, and use an instruction dataset for supervised fine-tuning. Fine-tune the model using RLHF or DPO, where human feedback is used to adjust the model's parameters to produce more human-like responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluation: Use a combination of automatic metrics (perplexity on TruthfulQA, Winogrande, and PKU RLHF dataset) to assess the model's performance. Iteratively improve the model based on these evaluations to ensure that it generates responses that are coherent, relevant, and engaging. By addressing the problem through this well-defined, measurable, and replicable approach, we aim to bridge the gap between AI-generated responses and human expectations, ultimately enhancing the practical usability of conversational AI systems."

    "\n",
    "With limited amount of fine-tuning using DPO, the model's performance has improved for all datasets, showing that DPO is an effective method to align the model with human preferences. The DPO method explores the potential of the SFT model and makes it clearer how the model can meet user requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the high perplexity score on the Winogrande dataset indicates that instruction format is crucial for the model's performance. The model needs to be trained on a more diverse dataset to improve its performance on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRA need a larger learning rate than we expected\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pre-training process, the peak learning rate should be around 5e-5; in full parameter fine-tuning, the peak learning rate should be around 2e-7. \n",
    "However, it is not clear for us what is the appropriate learning rate for LoRA fine-tuning. Since there are not many parameters for Adam to update, the learning rate can be larger than the full parameter fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA already limits the degree to diverge from the base model, so a larger learning rate can help the model to learn faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The model size is a significant limitation. 124M is a toy size for a language model, so the model cannot remember too much knowledge. The training time is also a limitation, because the model needs to be trained for a long time to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, GPT2 architecture is old for now; other position embedding methods and transformer architectures may have better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test set contamination can be another potential problem, because they may have the same prompt and similar responses, making the score better than normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bias and Fairness\n",
    "**Problem**: Language models can inadvertently learn and propagate biases present in the training data. This can lead to generating responses that are discriminatory or offensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation**:\n",
    "- **Diverse Dataset**: Ensure that the training dataset, such as UltraChat 200k, is diverse and representative of different demographics and perspectives.\n",
    "- **Bias Audits**: Regularly audit the model for biased behavior.\n",
    "- **Fairness Constraints**: Incorporate fairness constraints during model training to reduce biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Misuse of the Model\n",
    "**Problem**: The conversational AI could be used maliciously, for instance, to create deepfake dialogues, spread misinformation, or engage in manipulative conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation**:\n",
    "- **Usage Policies**: Implement strict usage policies and guidelines that prohibit the use of the model for harmful purposes.\n",
    "- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Establish mechanisms for monitoring the use of the model and reporting misuse. This can include user behavior tracking and automated detection of suspicious activity."
