Our goal is to fine-tune a chat model using RLHF, with a filtered version of the UltraChat dataset, containing approximately 200,000 high-quality conversational interactions. The data represents diverse dialogues measured by metrics such as coherence, relevance, and engagement. We will use this dataset to enhance our model's ability to generate human-like, contextually appropriate responses. Performance will be assessed using automatic metrics like perplexity and BLEU scores, as well as human evaluations of fluency, relevance, and overall conversational quality. Success will be determined by the model's improved capability to produce coherent and engaging dialogues that mimic human conversation.
